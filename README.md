# MapGen
## A small project to better understand shaders and other creative software.
**ARCHIVED** due to the fact JavaScript takes forever to run. This software does run, albeit extremely slowly due to all the checks required for proper bilateral filtering and other such common shaderlang techniques.
Will revisit when I learn .vert and .frag langs (GLSL).
For now, a prior beta version will be posted in the website.
